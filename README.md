# browserSync-Talk
This repository is simply to store the PowerPoint and any other related materials for the SanDiego.js talk for April 4th, 2017.

I'll be referring to another repository [react-starter-kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit) which contains an existing project with a working browserSync install. It should be the easiest way for a beginner to use browserSync.

You'll want to use the [getting-started](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) page to download and install the demo.
